// C++ main() Function
// -------------------
    // - Every C++ program must have one or more functions, with one named main.
    // - The operating system calls main to run the program.
    // - main is defined like any other function with a return type (int), a function name (main), optional parameters (empty in this case), and a body.

// Function Definition
    // - A function has four parts: return type, function name, parameters, and the body.
    // - The body is enclosed in {} and contains statements, with the return statement marking the end.

// Return Type of main
    // - main must return an int (an integer).
    // - A return value of 0 indicates success, and non-zero values indicate errors or other statuses.

// Semicolons
    // - A semicolon ; is required at the end of most statements in C++. Missing it causes errors.

// Types
    // - Types define the kind of data a variable holds (e.g., int, float).
    // - Every variable has a type, which determines the operations that can be performed on it.
